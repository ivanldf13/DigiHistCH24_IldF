# Abstract

This paper aims to analyse the evolution of the development concept throughout the Rockefeller Foundation’s first century of existence, utilising its annual reports. Drawing inspiration from Moretti & Pestre’s influential working paper – Banskpeak – our methodology consists of a two-fold approach. Firstly, we conducted a quantitative language analysis of the language employed in the Rockefeller Foundation’s annual reports. Here, using R we did a Structural Topic Modelling. Secondly, building upon the outcomes of this initial quantitative analysis, we delved into the activities and institutions in which the Foundation was involved to reconstruct its evolving development concept. This approach allowed us to observe how the meaning of development evolved, accumulating new connotations over time.

We started our analysis at the beginning of the 20th century because – even though the development concept was not formally coined until 1949 – the Foundation was already involved in development activities and institutions before that date. Furthermore, this actor had a set of ideas from the beginning of its activities that continued to influence
its actions even after the formalisation of the development concept. In this sense, we explored the significance of the self-help ethic and market-oriented mentality in other spheres of development.

Consequently, we demonstrated that self-help had consistently played a pivotal role in the Foundation’s development strategy since the Foundation’s inception. Furthermore, we scrutinised the roles ascribed by the Foundation to various actors in the development process. While the Foundation initially regarded the State as the primary actor in development, by the study period’s end, new participants such as private companies, communities, and individuals had become integral to this process.[^1]

# Key-points

\- The analysis demonstrated that the Foundation's concept of development evolved significantly, incorporating layers such as economic, social, cultural, and environmental aspects over time.

\- The STM efficiently captured the temporal dynamics undergone by the Foundation's development concept. 

\- The study highlighted the critical importance of combining advanced digital methodologies with traditional hermeneutical analysis and bibliographical review to fully understand the nuanced development concepts and the shifting roles of political actors and self-help mentalities.



# Introduction

In our presentation, we will explore how Digital Humanities (DH) tools can be utilised in the work of historians. We will begin by providing context on our use of these tools during the writing of a master's thesis in economic history. This thesis analysed the history of the concept of development, focusing on the case of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1913 to 2013. We will then provide an overview of our primary sources, followed by the main part of our presentation, which will concentrate on the methodology employed in our research. Here, we will explain our preference for Structural Topic Modelling. Finally, we will present our reflections on the use of DH tools for historiographic analysis, how these tools can complement traditional hermeneutics, and their limitations.


# Context

Since our study aimed to trace the evolution of the concept of development over a century, we were confronted with a large number of primary sources, specifically the Annual Reports of the Rockefeller Foundation.[^2] It was necessary to find a system that could summarise such a vast amount of information without losing detail and guide us to the most important parts of the primary sources. To manage and interpret this vast amount of data without losing essential details, we turned to DH tools, which leverage computational methods to enhance humanities research. It is worth noting that this field relies on computational methods to enrich humanities scholarship using digital techniques such as text mining and network analysis. The influence of Moretti and Pestre's seminal 'Bankspeak' working paper, [@moretti_bankspeak_2015]  presented by our thesis supervisor Professor O'Sullivan, guided our approach towards mixed methodologies. In their paper, Moretti and Pestre faced a similar challenge – dealing with a substantial number of annual reports to analyse. 

Moretti and Pestre addressed the challenge of processing numerous annual reports by applying quantitative linguistic analysis techniques to uncover patterns such as the most frequent words, the most common part of speech, word clusters, and the relationships between specific terms and their collocates. These quantitative insights were further enriched by qualitative analyses of language features like nominalisations, acronyms, gerunds, and adverbs relating to time and space

These techniques enabled the authors to identify and understand the changes in the semantic and grammatical structures used by the World Bank (W.B.) in its annual reports. After analysing these structures, Pestre and Moretti concluded that there was a discontinuity in these language structures in the last decade of the 20th century. Therefore, their methods seemed greatly beneficial to us. Nevertheless, our work differs in several ways from theirs. While our quantitative techniques go further than simply counting words, our qualitative analysis does not delve as deeply into the analysis of nominalisations, acronyms, gerunds, and temporal and spatial adverbs as theirs does.

[^2]: From now on referred to as the Foundation


# Primary sources

We chose as primary sources the Foundation’s Annual Reports for two reasons. The first one is quantitative. The Annual Reports were published annually from 1915 to 2016, with the 1913 and 1914 reports issued jointly in 1915. With this extensive temporal coverage, the Foundation lends itself as an excellent observatory to study the evolution of the concept of development before and after the emergence of this concept. 

The second reason is qualitative. The main objective of annual reports is to communicate the activities of the Foundation, its financial operations, its priorities, its vision of the issues it faces, and a self-assessment of its own actions in the past and those to be adopted in the future. Although the structure of the annual reports has changed over time, the content has remained stable. The Foundation presents with them a summary of its activities but also presents a narrative that seeks to communicate the reasoning and justification behind the Foundation’s activities. In this sense, the annual reports are a showcase in which the Foundation displays, promotes and justifies its values. 

Moreover, since these reports are public, they serve two functions. The first is purely functional. The reports inform the reader of the Foundation’s activities, its financial state, and other relevant details. The second function is symbolic. As Peter Goldmark Jr. (president of the Foundation from 1988 to 1997) noted, philanthropic foundations lack the three disciplines American life has: the test of the markets, the test of the elections and the press that analyses every move. [@rockefeller_foundation_annual_1998, pp. 3]  Therefore, the Foundation uses the annual reports as a form of self-evaluation, as a way to make itself accountable to the public and to offer a promotion and justification of the values that guide its activities. [@rockefeller_foundation_annual_1955, pp. 3]


# Methodology and its twists and turns

We began our quantitative analysis by importing the PDF reports into R using the ‘tidy’ principle [@silge_tidytext_2016, pp.1]  and then performing the necessary text cleaning to reduce the size of the corpus. This increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the analysis.[@gurusamy_preprocessing_2014]  We then proceeded with the analysis itself.


Initially, we employed basic text analysis techniques, namely counting the most frequent words per year and per period and using the TF-IDF.[^3] These techniques yielded promising results but were insufficient. Although the Foundation had the same objective throughout the period – “*to promote the well-being of mankind throughout the world*” – , [@rockefeller_foundation_annual_1915, pp.7; @rockefeller_foundation_annual_1964, pp.3; @rockefeller_foundation_annual_2014, pp.3] it used different words in absolute and relative terms to describe and justify its activities. 

[^3]:Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is a statistical measure used in text mining and information retrieval to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.

However, in terms of visualisation, precision and displaying temporal dynamics, the capabilities of these two techniques are worse than those of Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC) and Structural Topic Modelling (STM). Moreover, the former techniques are unable to create clusters and topics, unlike the latter two.


We continued with the HCPC, using only nouns, as this part of speech is the most suitable for analysing topics.[@suh_socialterm-extractor_2019, pp.2]  This technique confirmed the findings of the absolute frequency analysis and the TF-IDF. That is, there is structure in the use of words by the Foundation, as reflected both in the biplot created by the Correspondence Analysis (CA) necessary to perform the HCPC and in the final clusters. In the biplot in @fig-1.top25, the documents are organised in a temporal manner and, being together with each other, this indicates that they favour and avoid the same words regardless of the number of words in each document.[@becue-bertaut_textual_2019, pp.18-19]  Specifically, we observed that the Foundation used more frequently terms such as ‘infection’ or ‘hookworm’ and less frequently terms such as ‘resilience’ or ‘climate’ at the beginning of the period. Furthermore, when clustering after the CA and analysing the words contained in each cluster, it is observed that the Foundation, over time, diversifies the topics in which it engages, following a chronological trend. However, the visualisation of the clusters does not significantly enhance our understanding of the matter.

![Top 25 contributors to the two first dimensions](Figure 1.Top_25_Contributors.png){#fig-1.top25}


Despite offering us greater certainty regarding the temporal structure of the language used, the HCPC does not possess the precision of the next technique we employed: the Structural Topic Modelling with temporal metadata. In a CA with two dimensions, the closer a word, report, or cluster is to the origin of coordinates, the lower its explanatory power, as it represents a smaller percentage of the variance. In our case, there is one cluster almost at the origin of coordinates and two others not far from the central values of one or the other dimension.

Next, we employed the STM using also only nouns. As a topic modelling technique, the STM seeks to discover latent topics assumed to be generated by the corpus to be analysed, and the researcher must define the number of topics. Since there is no ‘correct’ number of topics for a corpus, we followed Roberts et al.’s methodology.[-@roberts_structural_2014]  Thus, we quantitatively measured semantic coherence[^4]  and topic exclusivity[^5]  by standardising these scores and choosing a number of topics that balances them well.

[^4]: Words more likely to appear in a topic are more likely to appear together within documents
[^5]: Words more likely to appear in one topic are less likely to appear in another

![Table with the topical content](Topics_DHCH.png){#tbl-topics}

Once we chose the number of topics, we obtained two lists of nouns associated with each topic, as shown in @tbl-topics. One list groups the nouns most likely to appear in each topic (Highest Prob list), while the other groups those that are frequent and exclusive (FREX list). These lists allow us to discover the central topics without our prior biases. We then named each topic using both lists and analysed the most representative reports for each topic. Therefore, this approach is a mixture of the methods suggested by Roberts et al.[-@roberts_structural_2014, pp.1068] and Grajzl & Murrell.[-@grajzl_toward_2019, pp.10] 

![Topical prevalence of the topics correlated with time](plot.expected.topic.proportions.png){#fig-topical_prev}

Subsequently, we calculated the frequency of each topic in our corpus, as shown in @fig-topical_prev , and deduced the importance of each topic for the Foundation's promotion of development.

![Topics and their correlation with time metadata](noun_topics_gamma.png){#fig-top_corr_time}

Furthermore, by using STM with temporal metadata, we identified which topics the Foundation addressed in its annual reports and their statistical relation to time. This approach enabled us to observe how the frequency of particular topics changed over time. The distribution of these topics over time is illustrated in @fig-top_corr_time.


Finally, using the Highest Prob and FREX lists @tbl-topics, and the most prominent reports of each topic, we examined the activities and institutions in which the Foundation was involved to reconstruct the development concept and the ideas underpinning it.


# Reflections

The Structural Topic Modelling provided an innovative way to understand and quantitatively evidence the main topics in which the Foundation was involved in promoting development. However, this evidence needed to be interpreted with a thorough ex ante understanding of the subject and the historical contexts of the corpus. Moreover, in our case, it was impossible to answer certain research questions with the results of the STM due to its probabilistic nature. After conducting a sound bibliographical review, we anticipated a change in the role of different political actors in the development arena and recognised the significance of the self-help and market-oriented mentality in the Foundation’s development concept. However, since these issues were addressed in so few extracts, the STM overlooked them. To address this shortcoming, we conducted a close reading to answer our research questions highlighting, therefore, the complementarity of digital methods with close reading and the importance of the historian's hermeneutic work when analysing the results of both. More specifically, this efficiency in analysing large volumes of textual data can be enhanced by the hermeneutical tools of what is termed new intellectual history, as the latter is particularly well-suited to examining changes in knowledge regimes and how power is exercised through discourse. Furthermore, this historiographical approach effectively complements the quantitative analysis provided by the STM by offering a contextual analysis that STM overlooks, such as the historical context in which the primary sources were produced.
